But, after going to the market, I arrived in home and watching the unreleased video by Seventeen In The Soop, and played Don't Starve Together with my little cousin, Isabela. She is not good kkkk but was fun this time. We die, and it is impossible keep this save, it's winter and we can't get warm. Anyway, I wanna play a little today to, I will try. <br><br> I really won't workout yesterday, but I did, just 8 minutes.

            <h3>05.03.23</h3>
            <p>Today is sunday and now is 22h53. I arrived in some minutes ago to my cousin's house. My cousin, Milena, she get aproved in the university and today we had a barbecue to celebrate her achivements. We watched a movie that I don't remeber the name, but it is about a trip to the moon and has chineses characters, I think. Hum, I watched my cousins and their cousins playing domino. And we had a lot of diferent topic of talk, since the ex-girlfriend of my brother to laws things or moments that happened in the past. And, I really enjoyed this talk time. I fell connected with them, and I would had like to taked more time there, but it was late, so me and my mom come back to our home. 
                <br><br>And before we go to the "party", I went to the hospital with my dad, he is dramatic but I know that his throut is really damage. Honestly, he could had go to the hospital by himself, but a lot of times he costum to act like a child, and I get mad with that. Anyways, he had nothing serious, and he will be better after rest and take medicines.
                <br><br>After arrived in home, I talked a little with my mom, take care of my dog and came to the computer. I installed some softwares and I am writing this right now. I will watching some videos on youtube soon, Going Seventeen, I really like the Bad Clue episode, so I will watch again, I wanna laugh a little before sleep.
