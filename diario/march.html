            <p>I'll start writing about yesterday, since I begun this diary today. <br><br> During my day I don't do nothing especial, to be honest. But, after going to the market, I arrived in home and watching the unreleased video by Seventeen In The Soop, and played Don't Starve Together with my little cousin, Isabela. She is not good kkkk but was fun this time. We die, and it is impossible keep this save, it's winter and we can't get warm. Anyway, I wanna play a little today to, I will try. <br><br> I really won't workout yesterday, but I did, just 8 minutes.
